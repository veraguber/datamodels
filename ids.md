The data model that I discovered that was not covered by this course is a network data model. This type of model allows for more complicated relationships between elements in the data compared to a heiarchial data model for example. I didn't find an associated website for the selected database product since it seems like network data models were more popular a couple of decades ago but other models have replaced them in recent times. The product name is Integrated Data Store. It was a commercial product, and the hosting model is on a single server, so probably client-server. For Java to access it, requires the use of JDBC drivers
